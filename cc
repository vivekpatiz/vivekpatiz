Project: Credit Union Digital Banking Platform

Description:
The Credit Union Digital Banking Platform is a financial services solution designed for credit unions in the UK, enabling seamless account management, loan processing, and digital banking services. The platform was developed to serve four credit unions, ensuring a streamlined and efficient banking experience.

The system consists of three core applications:
	1.	Onboarding Application – A form-based system for new customer registration, allowing users to open savings accounts, term deposits, and loan accounts.
	2.	Customer Channel (NetBanking) – A secure online platform where customers can view transactions, perform fund transfers, apply for loans, and manage multiple financial services.
	3.	Admin Application – A backend tool for administrators to lock/unlock accounts, block/unblock users, approve transactions, and manage compliance operations.

The platform is built using Angular 6, providing a scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly experience with responsive UI components, API-driven architecture, and robust state management.

This version keeps it structured while ensuring clarity. Let me know if you need any tweaks!
