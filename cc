Project Description:
    Credit unions in the UK are financial cooperatives that provide savings, loans, and other financial services to their members. We develop a product which gives services for the users so that they can create a savings account, termdeposit, loan account and many other financial services. We served services for 4 credit unions. Each Implementions has three applications which is onboarding application, Customer Channel, Admin Applications. In onboarding application we onboard the customer who wants to create an account in that implementation. It is like form based applications. As customer Channel is the Netbanking services provided for the customer who is onboarded and verified from backend where they can check their transaction or do transaction or create more accounts and more services are provided. Admin applications is where we provided services for customer lock and unlock feature. Block and unblock and all many admin activities are handled.
