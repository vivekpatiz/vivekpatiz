Bancs may buzz with tasks all day,
But coffee calls, we run that way!
We laugh of trades, both loss and gain,
And joke till deadlines seem less pain.

A friend at work, the best of perks,
Together we dodge the project quirks.
With sips and smiles, the stress takes flight,
And every break just feels so right!
