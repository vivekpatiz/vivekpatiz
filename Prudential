1. Project Description:(Please create a description by ur own)
    Prudential provides an exclusive platform for internal customers to create an entity which is maintained and which they use that entity to track or use for
	and it has crud operations create entity, modify entity, delete and view entity. It is like ticketing system where they will create an entity and admin will check that modify or revert it back to them. We have an option to upload documents to support created entity. So that admin can accept the entity. Then it will move to next level of verification. 
	Note for chatgbt: It works like ticket handling but u chatgbt can create a description according to ur understanding. I will prepare according to that. Here we used the latest angular version.
