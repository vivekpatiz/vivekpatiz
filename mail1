Hi Hema, Vivek,
Please replace the MBS logo with TCS BaNCS in the MBS QA environment and confirm once done. Please target to complete this by afternoon today so that we can verify the necessary changes.

This is required for a customer demo scheduled on 28-Aug.  Please take guidance from Sanna if required.



Once the Demo is over, we would need to change it back to MBS logo on Friday, 29-Aug.
